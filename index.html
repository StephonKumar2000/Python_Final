    <h5>Project Summary</h5>
    <p>This project was mainly about seeing which boros have safe places to eat based on their inspection and violations. My hypothesis was that there are going to be a majority of A rated inspections in NYC beacause we are a tourist state. Since we are a tourist state keeping thing clean and safe is very important to the success of being an NYC resturant. So the data methods I took were using graphs to show the boros inspection from A, B, and C. I got my data from public file of recent ratings in 2021. Using that file I made a Python3 project that would filter out the results I am looking for. Using the Graphs and Data link above you can see the results and explaination of the codes per section.</p>

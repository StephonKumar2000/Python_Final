      <h5>Data One</h5>
      <p>In this graph it is showing the data for each boro in a bar graph format. This graph is showing the rating per boro for each grade of A, B, and C. It is color coded to represent each of the boros. For this graph I created it using Python3 and using the libraries known as seaborn and matplot. I used plt.style.use("fivethirtyeight") to display this graph.</p>

        <h5>Data Two</h5>
        <p>In this graph I am displaying the combination of all the boros grades from A to C. I used a pie chart to demonstrate that in Python3. I used the libraries seaborn and matplot as well. Pandas was also used to sort and filter the data I wanted to show.</p>

          <h5>Data Three</h5>
          <p>In this graph I am showing each boro in a pie graph of the grades A to C to show which of these boros have better A ratings. This would help someone to decided where is the most safe boro to eat at as well and show where other boros need to work on getting more safe and bettering their inspection grades. I used matplot and seaborn libraries in Python3 to display the data. I used the pandas library to sort and filter the data per boro. Lasty I used an axis setup to show all five boros pie graph.</p>
